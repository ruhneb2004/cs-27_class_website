# Ceeyees 27 Class Website

This is the offical class website for the CSE 27 batch of GEC Thrissur. This is not complete by any means, but it will be soon(well I guess 😅...). The website provides details about every student of our batch and also showcases info about event, achievements and what not. This is an open source project and this could be much more than what I going to describe here, so feel to check out and maybe contribute a little.

### Disclaimer
Before I begin, I have created this template website in a very small amount of time and I am not sure about the security it provides, so don't put sensitive info or photos.

The website is view only for the outsiders, only the people of the CSE 27 batch can login with their college email id, so for making any changes on the website do login with that email id!

## Some Common Questions

### How does this work? What is going on here?

Well it's alright to be a little confused at first, as there are many files and all but soon you will get the gist of this. The entire website is written in **javascript**, it's not plain js but a little bit different. I will explain what is different here in a min. The entire website is written using a framework called **nextjs** it's a framework of react which is a framework js 😵‍💫. Well it's a bit confusing and you don't really need to know all that stuff, but it's what it's used to write in. So if you want to contribute here or add some major feature you may have to look it up a bit (well not if you are adil). For styling many of you may have used plain css but it's a bit redundant and difficult to manange, so I have opted for using **tailwind**. Tailwind is pretty simple, it's basically writing your css inside your div elements. The elements in the page like button, modals, input boxes and some other things from **daisyui** and **shadcn**, this things make development very easy so do try to use and understand them effectively. You are not limited to these ones only, there are many others like **magicui**. You can add them if you want, no LIMITS!!! But be thoughtfull cause it may increase the project size and cause it to be laggy. Try to make the best use of exiting resources and then only proceed to add something new.

### For cse27 students

You guys have to make a neccessary contribution here, it's pretty simple you guys just have to make a portfolio like page here. When you exploring the code you can see where it is. But I will tell you anyway, in the membersPage folder you have to create a folder with you first name. It's very important to only use your firstName. This page will be visible on clicking your icons in the members page through the nav bar. So all the best, try to make it as unique as possible!

### Well what did I use create to these template thingy

Inshort nextjs is the backbone of this project, so you defininetly have to look into it. For database I have used **postgres** whihc is a **sql** database. You don't really have to know sql for communicating with the DB, I have used prisma here which makes it easy for data insertion, deletion... **prisma** is an ORM which is super cool and let's you do many things. The backend is completey in nextjs, so it's also pretty easy to deploy. The frontend logic is written in js and other styling related things are as mentioned above! These are some of the things you have to be familiar with, you can try to learn all this at once or focus on specific parts of the project like for example backend. Learn required part for the project and try to implement what you have in mind. You can explore them independly on your own also you can approach anyone of us regarding your doubts.

### How can I contribute, what are the steps for proposing new changes and features?

Well it's very similar to the standard open source contribution.
1. Create an issue and describe what you intent with max clarity. Someone will come in touch with you and will guide you as needed.
2. Don't spam issues, or purposefully disturb the community

### Conclusion

This is in short a small scale open source project and you can contribute here as much as you want. Also don't be shy to put forward you ideas, just be free and express yourself. And for any help you can contact us, we would be pretty happy to help you guys along the way!

### Some Very Neccessary Contributions Which are most welcome
