# Ceeyees 27 Class Website

This is the offical class website for the CSE 27 batch of GEC Thrissur. This is not complete by any means, but it will be soon(well I guess üòÖ...). The website provides details about every student of our batch and also showcases info about event, achievements and what not. This is an open source project and this could be much more than what I going to describe here, so feel to check out and maybe contribute a little.

### Disclaimer
Before I begin, I have created this template website in a very small amount of time and I am not sure about the security it provides, so don't put sensitive info or photos.

The website is view only for the outsiders, only the people of the CSE 27 batch can login with their college email id, so for making any changes on the website do login with that email id!

## Some Common Questions

### How does this work? What is going on here?

Well it's alright to be a little confused at first, as there are many files and all but soon you will get the gist of this. The entire website is written in **javascript**, it's not plain js but a little bit different. I will explain what is different here in a min. The entire website is written using a framework called **nextjs** it's a framework of react which is a framework js üòµ‚Äçüí´. Well it's a bit confusing and you don't really need to know all that stuff, but it's what it's used to write in. So if you want to contribute here or add some major feature you may have to look it up a bit (well not if you are adil). For styling many of you may have used plain css but it's a bit redundant and difficult to manange, so I have opted for using **tailwind**. Tailwind is pretty simple, it's basically writing your css inside your div elements. The elements in the page like button, modals, input boxes and some other things from **daisyui** and **shadcn**, this things make development very easy so do try to use and understand them effectively. You are not limited to these ones only, there are many others like **magicui**. You can add them if you want, no LIMITS!!! But be thoughtfull cause it may increase the project size and cause it to be laggy. Try to make the best use of exiting resources and then only proceed to add something new.

### Well what did I use create these template thingy

As I mentioned before I used nextjs
